Description: transitional dummy package for switching to Neutron Linuxbridge agent.
 This is a transitional dummy package due to the move of the Linuxbridge agent from
 core plugin to ML2 MechanismDriver.
 Once you have upgraded, this package can safely be removed. This package provides a
 transition path from neutron-plugin-linuxbridge-agent to neutron-linuxbridge-agent.
